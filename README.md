This script syncs files between local folders and cloud drive folders.  My primary motivation for this is because there is currently not a good syncing solution provided by my cloud service providers for linux and my preferred computing platform (raspberry pi).

Dependency: rclone

Todo:
    1. move configuration file to ./config/cloud/
    2. move log file to ./config/cloud/
    3. change local data root folder to ./Cloud/
